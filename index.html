  <p>The Indian  history goes back to more than 5000 years or more. India is the largest democratic country with a population of 1.3 billion and it is the 31st most densely populated nation with 991 people per square mile. It is believed to be the oldest continuous civilization on the planet. Although India  was invaded many times by the invaders from different parts of the world, but  all blended in the society leaving rich cultural remnants behind. 
It was under Islamic rule for 300 years,under British rule for 200 years. It became independant of the British occupation in 1947, and was divided as India one part, and Pakistan a anothe rpart. India is considered as a “Federal parliamentary constitutional republic”.</p>

        <p>The most popular India tour is the all-time classic Golden Triangle. If time is short this is a fantastic introduction to three of India's top destinations, Delhi, Agra and Jaipur, and you can squeeze it into a week if you don't mind moving every couple of days. Start in Delhi, with sights such as Humayun's Tomb and the Red Fort, before hitting Agra and touring the Taj Mahal, Agra Fort and Fatehpur Sikri. Then it's on to Jaipur to explore the Pink City and the fort at Amber, before returning to Delhi's wonderful bazaars for a final shopping spree before you fly home.</p>

        <p> India is a secular country.  Two major religious groups in India, are Hindu (80%) and Muslims (10%).  But there are also small numbers of Buddhists, Christians, Parsee's, Sikhs and Jain living in India.</p>
		
		<p>  English is spoken almost everywhere (making it the largest English speaking country in the world). The number of distinctly different languages highlights the fact that India is extremely culturally diverse and in many ways like a collection of countries rather than one country. </P>

       <h2><a href="food" ></a> Exotic Food You will Love</h2>
       <p>Indian food is very diverse. It varies from state to state.  There is no definition of Indian meal.  Indians are mostly vegetarian but some are not.  Cooking Indian food is fun.  Each region has their own types of food.  India produces aromatic spices, rice etc, which is a major part of Indian cuisine. </p>
